/* An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
 rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
 interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
 bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is
 then initialized to contain information for random number generation with
 that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state
 information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by
 calling the setstate() function with the same array as was initiallized
 with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state
 information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
 congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.  Internally, the
 state information is treated as an array of longs; the zeroeth element of
 the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small integer); the remainder
 of the array is the state information for the R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of
 state information will give 7 longs worth of state information, which will
 allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note: The zeroeth word of state
 information also has some other information stored in it; see setstate
 for details).  The random number generation technique is a linear feedback
 shift register approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms
 to sum up that way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all
 the numbers in the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register,
 and will have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial
 being used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).
 The higher order bits will have longer periods, since their values are
 also influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The
 total period of the generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus
 doubling the amount of state information has a vast influence on the
 period of the generator.  Note: The deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation
 only good for large deg, when the period of the shift register is the
 dominant factor.  With deg equal to seven, the period is actually much
 longer than the 7*(2**7 - 1) predicted by this formula.  */



/* For each of the currently supported random number generators, we have a
 break value on the amount of state information (you need at least thi
 bytes of state info to support this random number generator), a degree for
 the polynomial (actually a trinomial) that the R.N.G. is based on, and
 separation between the two lower order coefficients of the trinomial.  */
